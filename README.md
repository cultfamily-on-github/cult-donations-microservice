# CULT Learn 2 Earn Microservice

CULT Learn 2 Earn gives you the chance to earn money while doing valuable things like providing education services around topics like decentralization, self-hosted wallets, deflationary currencies like CULT and RVLT, tokenomics which foster public goods creation etc. 

Here you can learn how to provide valuable education services to others by doing so. You can earn RVLT by submitting links to your education services. After that your public wallet address will be listed in the CULT Donations Microservice.  

Let us learn and earn together in playful creativity to free the world.

Learn 2 Earn is inspired by Play 2 Earn which is inspired by [Revolt 2 Earn](https://rumble.com/v1lf3yb-revolt-2-earn-in-100-seconds-michael-saylor-talks-about-revolt-2-earn.html?mref=1e5w3p&mc=4izal). 


In order to strengthen resilience, scalability, composability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture. 

Everyone is invited to foster the emergence of manifold architectures of freedom by contributing to this repository.


## Status
First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).

### Start Locally
To start the backend server locally you might execute:  

```sh
./start-learn-2-earn-server.sh locally
```

### Start in Production
```sh
./start-learn-2-earn-server.sh production mode
```
